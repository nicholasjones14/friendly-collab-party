### About this repository

This repository offers learning material for a practical session on "Developing Collaborative Documents", which will introduce you to [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a tool for creating documents online with your collaborators.

GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface to maintain and share your projects (repositories) and maintain the different versions of your documents with information such as which files change, what changed, who changed them, and why those updates were made. 

GitHub also provides access control (who can access your files, who can read or edit them) and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

### For learners

If you cannot find your specific workshop presentation from the list above, please use this **[presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_bmRZcLwQrUkVTAMvq7W_x4ML_aphSwVEnkLrDy-Fd4/edit?usp=sharing)** to guide your learning pace.

### Prerequisite

No prior experience with GitHub is needed. Bring any real-life scenario, where developing collaborative documents will be useful for you. Please bring your laptop to this event.

### Learning outcome

- The goal is to make you comfortable with a Collaborative workflow in the GitHub interface. 
- Practice adding resources to online project folders, working with tasks and issues, writing messages when committing to any change, making and reviewing change requests from others, and merging them. 
- You'll also practice good communication with contributors.
